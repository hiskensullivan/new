1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a .git folder to initialize the repository. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is essentially a logical area that you can selectively add the changes you made in the working directory. The user can then commit
    those changes to the repository. It offers code isolation and the ability to see what the differences are between the working directory and the repository,
    as well as the ability to selectively commit logical components together as opposed to all the changes you made since the last commit.
