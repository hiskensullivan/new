1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want an extra back up as well as work collaboratively.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it might make updates to your current working project that you do not want. Multiple people could be working on different things locally where 
    if updated from remote it could cause problems.
